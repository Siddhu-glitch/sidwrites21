        <h1><strong>When Love Haunts: The Why Behind the Pain</strong></h1>
        <p>Should I be the only one who feels this way,<br>
        Or does love make everyone feel like this?<br>
        Even when it breaks me, I want to stay—<br>
        Why am I like this? Why can't I just walk away?</p>

        <p>I’ve met you more in my dreams than in reality,<br>
        Lived a thousand moments with you that never came true.<br>
        I try to forget your smile, erase it from my mind,<br>
        But it clings to me, like a ghost that refuses to leave.</p>

        <p>Why do I hold on when it hurts this much?<br>
        Why can't I just let go, when all you did was leave?<br>
        Why does your memory haunt every quiet moment,<br>
        Even though you’re no longer here to share them?</p>

        <p>Why, why, why—<br>
        Is it love, or is it just me?<br>
        And why does it feel like I'm stuck loving the idea of you<br>
        More than the person you’ve become?</p>
